# Questions for the user

Decisions made without waiting for an answer. Each entry gives the question, the guess that was taken, and what to change if the answer is different. Newest first.

## URL matching: `UrlGlob` becomes `UrlMatch`

**Question:** Should URL matching use one sum type, as the TypeScript API does (`string | RegExp | URLPattern | function`)?

**Guess taken:** Yes. `UrlMatch` has three constructors: `UrlGlob` (the existing glob, unchanged), `UrlRegex` (source and flags), and `UrlPredicate` (client-side only). Routes and waits accept `UrlMatch`. The existing `UrlGlob` constructor is kept, so most call sites compile without change.

**To change:** If you'd rather keep glob-only and add separate regex functions, revert the rename and add `routeRegex` and similar.

## Regex engine: `regex-tdfa`

**Question:** Which regex engine should match JavaScript-style patterns?

**Guess taken:** `regex-tdfa`. It is pure Haskell, so the Nix shell needs no C library. It doesn't support lookahead, and its syntax is only close to JavaScript's.

**To change:** PCRE (through `pcre-light`) is closer to JavaScript, but it needs `libpcre` in `flake.nix`.

**Known gaps:** `regex-tdfa` has no `\d`, `\w` or `\s`, so `src/Playwright/UrlMatch.hs` rewrites those (and `\D \W \S`, and `\/`) into bracket expressions first. Lookahead, lookbehind and backreferences are not supported. Two predicates never compare equal, so `unroute` with a predicate cannot find its route.

## Predicates on routes

**Question:** A predicate cannot be sent to the server. How should `route` with a predicate behave?

**Guess taken:** Register the route with the glob `**/*` and check the predicate in the handler. Requests that don't match are continued unchanged. This matches how the TypeScript client behaves.

## Regex flags `g` and `y` are not sent to the driver

**Question:** Should a regex route send the `g` and `y` flags to the driver?

**Guess taken:** No. With `g`, the driver's stateful `test` misses the URL it checks second, so the route is skipped. Those two flags only affect stateful matching, and this library always wants a fresh test. `src/Playwright/Route/Intercept.hs` drops them before sending. Other flags are sent unchanged.

**To change:** If the driver is later fixed to reset `lastIndex`, the filter can go.
